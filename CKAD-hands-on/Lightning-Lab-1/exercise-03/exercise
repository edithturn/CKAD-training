Create a pod called time-check in the dvl1987 namespace.
 This pod should run a container called time-check that uses the busybox image.
Create a config map called time-config with the data TIME_FREQ=10 in the same namespace.
The time-check container should run the command: while true; do date; sleep $TIME_FREQ;done 
and write the result to the location /opt/time/time-check.log.
The path /opt/time on the pod should mount a volume that lasts the lifetime of this pod.
