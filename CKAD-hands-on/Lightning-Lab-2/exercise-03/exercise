Create a pod called my-busybox in the dev2406 namespace using the busybox image. The container should be called secret and should sleep for 3600 seconds.

The container should mount a read-only secret volume called secret-volume at the path /etc/secret-volume. The secret being mounted has already been created for you and is called dotfile-secret.

Make sure that the pod is scheduled on master/controlplane and no other node in the cluster.
