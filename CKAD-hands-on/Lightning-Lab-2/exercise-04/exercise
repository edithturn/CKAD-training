Create a single ingress resource called ingress-vh-routing. The resource should route HTTP traffic to multiple hostnames as specified below:

The service video-service should be accessible on http://watch.ecom-store.com:30093/video

The service apparels-service should be accessible on http://apparels.ecom-store.com:30093/wear


Here 30093 is the port used by the Ingress Controller
