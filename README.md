## Useful commands

### Shortcuts for Kubernetes Objects

You can use the following shortcuts for common Kubernetes objects:

| Shortcut | Object             | Shortcut    | Object                 |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| `po`     | Pods               | `cm`        | ConfigMaps             |
| `rs`     | ReplicaSets        | `secret`    | Secrets                |
| `deploy` | Deployments        | `ing`       | Ingresses              |
| `svc`    | Services           | `endpoints` | Endpoints              |
| `ns`     | Namespaces         | `netpol`    | Network Policies       |
| `pv`     | Persistent Volumes | `pvc`       | PersistentVolumeClaims |
| `sa`     | Service Accounts   |             |

### Use the right context always

```bash
# List all kubectl contexts configured in the kubeconfig file
kubectl config get-context

# Switch the current context to the specified cluster (replace 'new-context' with your desired context name)
kubectl config set current-context new-context

# Every time before to start the question
kubectl config use-contex <CONTEXTNAME>
```

### **My Setup (Optional) - Use Alias and ShortCuts**

```bash
alias k=kubectl
# Example: k get pods

alias kn='kubectl config set-context --current --namespace'
# Example: kn mynamespace

alias ka='kubectl apply -f'
# Example: ka pod.yaml

alias kr='kubectl replace --force -f'
# Example: kr pod.yaml

alias kd='kubectl delete --force --grace-period=0'
# Example: kd pod pod.yaml

export do='--dry-run=client -o yaml'
# Example: k run my-pod --image=nginx $do > pod.yaml
```

### Kubectl Contexts

```bash
# List all kubectl contexts configured in the kubeconfig file
kubectl config get-context

# Switch the current context to the specified cluster (replace 'new-context' with your desired context name)
kubectl config set current-context new-context
```

# **Tips** :gift:

- Attempt all questions - donâ€™t get stuck on any single one.
- Get comfortable with YAML.
- Use shortcuts and aliases to save time.
- Refer to Kubernetes documentation for most of what you need (And practice using it).
- Practice using imperative commands as much as possible [Kubectl Gettign Started](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#-strong-getting-started-strong-).
- Use the `kubectl explain` command to understand resources better.
- Manage your time effectively.
- Improve your speed and proficiency with VIM.
- If studying alone feels unmotivating, find a study buddy who is also preparing for the exam.
- Divide your study time equally between learning concepts and hands-on practice.
- Consider using AI to help study and practice for the exam. While some may disagree, I found it incredibly helpful for clarifying simple concepts.

## Vim Setup

Understand what these commands do and how to use it in Vim:
Open `vim ~/.vimrc`

```sh
set expandtab # This tells Vim to convert tabs into spaces.
set tabstop=2 # This sets the width of a tab character to 2 spaces.
set shiftwidth=2 # This controls the number of spaces used for auto-indentation when using commands like >> (indent) or << (outdent) in Vim.
```

## YAML file navigation in Vim

```bash
# Move the cursor left, down, up or right
- Use:
    h -> move to lef

- Esc :num + Enter  -> go a specific number  line in a file, example: Esc :22
- Esc + u           -> revert changes

# Indent several lines
- Shift + v         -> to visual mode and up and down arrows to move the cursor
- Shift + >         -> indentation to the right
- Shift + <         -> indentation to the left
- Shift + 2>         -> indentation to the right, two times
